## Maksym Balio
I checked your details and project carefully and started working already. jigsaw.js file is a little big for me to understand the entire logic.
I can do it within 1 day. And then I will send proposals on Upwork.
By the way, please share the git access to push new branch. That's why I updated this readme even though it's very uncomfortable for you.

Sorry.
